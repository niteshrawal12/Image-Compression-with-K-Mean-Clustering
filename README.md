#### 
Image Compression with K-Means Clustering Project is Build Using Python , K-mean and scikit-learn:.:
1.	Explain the steps involved in k-means clustering.
2.	Apply k-means clustering with scikit-learn and Python to compress images.
3.	Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter widgets


Project Structure # üõ†Ô∏è and used technologies
project on Image Compression with K-Means Clustering is divided into the following tasks:
Task 1: Introduction and Overview
‚Ä¢	Introduction to the image compression problem with machine learning.
‚Ä¢	See a demo of the final product you will build by the end of this project.
‚Ä¢	Introduction to the Rhyme interface.
‚Ä¢	Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Widgets.
Task 2: Data Pre-processing
‚Ä¢	Import images from a local directory and store them as numpy arrays.
‚Ä¢	Explore the image attributes.
‚Ä¢	Normalize the pixel values and unroll the arrays into vectors.
Task 3: Visualizing the Color Space using Point Clouds 
‚Ä¢	Visualize the set of pixels from the original image as a two 2-D point clouds in color space.
Task 4: Visualizing the K-Means Reduced Color Space
‚Ä¢	Understand the math and steps involved in the k-means clustering algorithm.
‚Ä¢	Perform k-means clustering with scikit-learn's MiniBatchKMeans to reduce the number of possible colors in the image from over 16 million to 16.
‚Ä¢	Compare and contrast the color space of the original image with that of the k-means compressed image.
Task 5: Creating Interactive Controls with Jupyter Widgets
‚Ä¢	Use the interact function to automatically create UI controls for function arguments.
‚Ä¢	Define an argument to control the value of k using a slider.
‚Ä¢	Define an argument to pick any image from a specified directory.
Task 6: K-means Image Compression with Interactive Controls
‚Ä¢	Ensures that k-means image compression is performed only on the slider widget's mouse release events.
‚Ä¢	Repurpose the data pre-processing and k-means clustering logic from previous tasks to operate on images of your choice.
‚Ä¢	Visualize how the image changes as the number of clusters fed to the k-means algorithm is varied.

Image Compression with K-Mean Clustering #MLproject Unsupervised Technique based on 16 million colors represented as 16 colors to compress the image
That involved k-means clustering with scikit-learn and Python to compress images by Creating interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter widgets
where i have used  essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Widgets.
staring from #Datapreprocessing to Import images from a local directory and store them as numpy arrays. then
Visualize the set of pixels from the original image as a two 2-D point clouds in color space. and Perform k-means clustering with scikit-learn's  to reduce the number of possible colors in the image from over 16 million to 16 
also Created an Interactive Controls with Jupyter Widgets.
